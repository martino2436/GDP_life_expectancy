Notes Life Expectancy GDP Portfolio:

Project Goal: 
Determing whether there is a correlation between the GDP and the life expectancy by looking at the data from 6 countries
across 15 years.

We are using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries from Python. Even maybe NumPy.

Pandas tasks:
- tidy dataset
- convert GDP approprietly 

Visualization to present:

- barplots to show Average GDP per country & Average Life Expectancy
- scatter plot to show the relation between GDP & Life Expectancy per countries
- barpolots Life expectancy and GDP overtime for each country on the same graph
- show the distribution for life expectancy and GDP over time per countries using histogtams and box plots
